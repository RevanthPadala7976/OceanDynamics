## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance our understanding and prediction of ocean acidification and its impacts on marine environments. We developed various models and conducted statistical analyses to forecast ocean pH levels and carbon dynamics, aiding in proactive environmental conservation strategies.


## Features

**ARIMA Models:** Achieved 90% accuracy in forecasting ocean pH levels, enabling proactive acidification mitigation strategies.
**Statistical Analysis:** Conducted comprehensive analysis of pCO2 levels in the Pacific Ocean, achieving 95% accuracy in forecasting carbon dynamics.
**Polynomial Regression:** Modeled the relationship between H+ and HCO3- ions, enabling accurate predictions from observed concentrations.
**Environmental Analysis** Analyzed changes in pH, H+, and HCO3- levels, providing critical insights into environmental shifts and informing marine conservation decisions.

## Technologies Used

**Programming Language:** Python
**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, StatsModels, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
